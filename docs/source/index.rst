TUEplots reference documentation
================================

TUEplots is a light-weight matplotlib extension
that adapts your figure sizes to formats more suitable for scientific publications.
It produces configurations that are compatible with matplotlib's `rcParams`,
and provides fonts, figure sizes, font sizes, color schemes, and more, for a number of publication formats.
